# ACHE Focused Crawler

## Introduction

ACHE is an implementation of a focused crawler. A focused crawler is a web crawler that collects Web pages that satisfy some specific property, by carefully prioritizing the crawl frontier and managing the hyperlink exploration process [[1]].

## Installation


### Download with Conda

You can download `ache` from Binstar [[2]] with Conda [[3]] by running:

```bash
conda install -c memex ache
```
NOTE: Only tagged versions are published to Binstar, so `ache` from Binstart may be outdated.
If you want to try the most recent version, please clone the repository, compile the code using instructions below and then start the crawler using `ache` located in `build/install/ache/bin`.

### Build from source with Gradle

To build `ache` from source, you can run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/ache.git
cd ache
./gradlew clean installApp
```

which will generate an installation package under `/build/install/`.

Alternatively, you can build a zip archive:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/ache.git
cd ache
./gradlew clean distZip
```

which will generate a zip file of your project under `/build/distributions/`.

## Build a model for ACHE's page classifier
(If you already have the model, skip this step.)

To focus on a certain topic ACHE needs to have access to a model of its content. This model is then 
used by a classifier to decide, given a new crawled page, whether it is on-topic or not. Assume that you store positive and negative examples in two directories, `positive` and `negative`. Also, assume these directories are placed in the `training_data` directory. Here is how you build a model from these examples:

    ./build/install/ache/bin/ache buildModel -t <training data path> -o <output path for model> -c <stopwords file path>

`<training data path>` is the path to the directory containing positive and negative examples.

`<output path>` is the new directory that you want to save the generated model that consists of two files: `pageclassifier.model` and `pageclassifier.features`. 
  
`<stopwords file path>` is a file with list of words that the classifier should ignore. Example: https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/ache/blob/master/config/sample_config/stoplist.txt

## Start ACHE

After you generate a model, you need to prepare the seed file, where each line is a URL. To start the crawler, run:

    ./build/install/ache/bin/ache startCrawl -o <data output path> -c <config path> -s <seed path> -m <model path> [-e <elastic search index name>]


`<configuration path>` is the path to the config directory.

`<seed path>` is the seed file.

`<model path>` is the path to the model directory (containing pageclassifier.model and pageclassifier.features).

`<data output path>` is the path to the data output directory.
 
 Example of running ACHE:
 
    ./build/install/ache/bin/ache startCrawl -o output -c config/sample_config -s config/sample.seeds -m config/sample_model -e achecrawler


## More information?

[ACHE Wiki](https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/ache/wiki)

## What is inside the data output directory?

`data_target` contains relevant pages.

`data_negative` contains irrelevant pages. In default setting, the crawler does not save the irrelevant pages.

`data_monitor` contains current status of the crawler.

`data_url` and `data_backlinks` are where persistent storages keep information of frontier and crawled graph.

## When to stop the crawler?

Unless you stop it, the crawler exists when the number of crawled pages exeeds the limit in the setting, which is 9M at default. You can look at this file `data_monitor/harvestinfo.csv` to know how many pages has been downloaded to decide whether you want to stop the crawler. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd columns are number of relevant pages, number of visited pages, timestamp.
