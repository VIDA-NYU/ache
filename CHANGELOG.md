## Version 0.7.0 (2016-11-27)

There were more than 100 commits since the last release 0.6.0 in July 8. Following are some of the improvements.

ACHE is now simpler to use and to configure:
- Added more specific configuration samples for focused crawling and in-depth website crawling
- Stopwords are now an optional parameter, and a embedded stopword list is used by default
- Added utility tools for working with CDR (Common Data Repository) files
- Added utility to print frontier links along with relevance scores
- Added configuration for HTTP connection pool size

ACHE is faster: we fixed synchronization and parallelism issues that led to improvements of crawler efficiency of 980% (a simple benchmark available at https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/ache/issues/56).

ACHE is more resilient due fix of bugs related to:
- Extraction of malformed URLs during HTML parsing
- Failures due to handling of URLs with IPv4 addresses
- Failure to train the linking classifier for certain configuration values
- Corruption of binary data improperly stored in strings

URL normalization added for links extracted from web pages, so less duplicate content will be fetched

Cleaned log messages and added logging of structured data in CSV files regarding:
- Download requests
- Links selected to be downloaded

Added detailed software metrics that allows better monitoring and detection of problems. Added metrics include shows counts, 1, 5 and 15-minute rates, mean, median, and 75%, 95%, 98% and 99% percentiles for
- URL fetch time
- Download page processing time
- Current download queue size
- Current processing and pending downloads in queue

ACHE has an improved data management:
- Added new page repository that stores multiple pages in rolling compressed files
- Added a new alternative database backend based on Facebook's RocksDB key-value store that improves efficiency and JVM memory management.

Some stability problems were solved, such as:
- Limiting size of downloader thread-pool queue sizes
- Properly close repository files during crawler shutdown
- Avoid start crawler shutdown multiple times

Other minor improvement such as:
- Migrated code base to Java 8
- More refactoring, code cleaning, and tests (coverage 44%)

- Added flexible way to different handlers for different types of links, which will allow to have different extractors for each content type such as HTML, media files, XML sitemaps, etc.
- Support for sitemap.xml protocol, which allows the crawler automatically discover all links along with some metadata specified by webmasters.

## Version 0.3.0 (2015-07-14)

We are pleased to announce version 0.3.0 of ACHE Crawler. Here we list the major changes since version 0.2.0 (note that some changes break compatibility with previous releases).

### New features:
- New command-line interface using named parameters
- Integration with ElasticSearch with configurable index names
- Added new way to configure different types of classifiers using YAML files (this will allow new types of classifiers be added later as well as "meta classifiers" which can combine any type of classifier, using votting or machine learning ensembles for example)

- Embedded language detection into crawler package to ease configuration for end user (before, the user needed to download external language profiles files and specify them in command line)
- Converted bash scripts to build SVM model to a single command written in cross-platform Java code
- Don't automatically remove data from existing crawl, just resume previous crawls.

### Bug fixes:
- Escaping HTML entities from extracted links (this was causing wrong links to be extracted and the crawler waste resources trying to download unexisting pages)
- Checking for empty strings in frontier and seed file
- Fixed computation of CCA key
- Insert URLs from the seed file only when they are not already inserted
- Added shutdown hook to close LinkStorage database properly
